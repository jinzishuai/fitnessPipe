# pre-requisites

- OBS is running to feed video as camera input. See [docs/android_testing_with_obs.md](../docs/android_testing_with_obs.md)
- Ideally, the emulator is already running
- The android phone has "Auto-Rotate" enabled: the [run-android-tests.sh](run-android-tests.sh) script will enable it automatically.
